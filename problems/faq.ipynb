You can find one approach to resolving problems of this sort in this and the subsequent worksheets."

    "Because Maple, Mathematica, and Wolfram Alpha are all paid for software which is closed source. Using these jupyter notebooks is free and the code behind sympy is also open source. This means that it is possible for anyone to understand how sympy (or any python package) works by inspecting the code directly, and figuring it out from there. Do I expect that you do this? No, but in theory it's important to know that, or be able to verify, that the mathematical results produced by any piece of software are valid. If you can't read the source code, then you can't do this, and have to trust that the software provider (Maple, Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha) has done it correctly for you. While most of the time this is probably the case, and while I'm sure that the companies behind these products put significant effort into ensuring that their software is correct, they can't guaranteed this in most cases, and there are always bugs in software. Sometimes these bugs can be super costly; see the [list of software bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_bugs) for some examples."

    "The solutions in these sheets are self-contained, and use very few features of sympy or python. The principal difficulty is usually formulating the problem so that the features available in sympy/python can be used to resolve that problem. This too is a useful skill for you to develop, in particular, because you'll quickly realise that essentially every (computational) problem you encounter in this course, or that you encountered in MT2501, boils down to solving a system of linear equations. Exactly how depends on the particular problem. There are plenty of examples in these notebooks explaining step-by-step how to do this."
